			<p>Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be,
			you must first decide on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is 
			the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each
			paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader
			that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph.</p>
			<p>A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole 
			process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are 
			direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.
			The decision about what to put into your paragraphs begins with the germination of a seed of ideas; this
			 “germination process” is better known as brainstorming.</p>
			<p> There are many techniques for brainstorming; 
			 whichever one you choose, this stage of paragraph development cannot be skipped. Building paragraphs 
			 can be like building a skyscraper: there must be a well-planned foundation that supports what you are
			 building. Any cracks, inconsistencies, or other corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole paper to crumble.</p>
